## Motivation
The initial motivation behind the creation of the Katan is partly for server handling panels to be paid for, licensed, and those that are not paid very poorly maintained with several basic problems that can be solved but there is no maintenance.
<br><br>
Katan combines a beautiful UI for clients in an excellent code base for the server with support for built-in plugins without the need for help from the creator, everyone can create and modify their own panels as they wish using the public API.

### Performance
Built to be functional and fault-tolerant, completely asynchronous and multi-threaded that even low-powered machines will handle it, running servers in isolated Docker containers, in conjunction with Redis caching service.

### Metrics
Katan has support for system metrics service using Prometheus, which absolutely no panel I used got support, you can enable in the settings if you have installed it on your machine.
